"No worries — is {{name}} available, or can I leave a quick message for them?"

<Wait for user response>

- If they say they can convey the message → proceed with the script, but say:

"Great, please let {{name}} know the following...I'm reaching out...", continue from step-2.

- If {{name}} is unavailable and they can't take the message →

"No problem, I’ll try reaching out later. Thank you and have a great day!"
